- 👋 Hi, I’m @Captain-AdHoc
- 👀 I’m interested in retro computers/tech/programming/gaming (mainly c64), 3d-printing, survivalism and prepping, kayaking, guitar-playing (jazz, bossa, classical, fingerstyle), amateur rocketry (long time ago, but still a lot of fun), historical medieval sword fighting (in the past, but still fun).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to read keystrokes in a non-blocking manner on Windows without missing keystrokes when holding a key pressed, which could happen when using `_kbhit()` and `_getch()` together.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects at work and any project that uses 6510 assembly for the C64 computer (I just love coding in 6510 assembly). I used to code a game for the C64 in asm using [`CBM prg Studio`](https://www.ajordison.co.uk/download.html).
- 📫 How to reach me: Make sure you are closer to me than the length of your arm.
- 😄 Pronouns: Baloney sandwich, pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis, supreme chancellor.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Ma boi was born on 9/11 (not that year though).
